# ROS_SimulationLabs
### Work with ROS in simulation over this six-week lab course and we have created a custom ROS Simulation Environment designed specifically for this course
### Work with a simulation of the TurtleBot3 Waffle made by Robotis. This is the 3rd Generation Robot in the TurtleBot family, which has been the reference hardware platform for ROS since 2010. This family of robots exists to provide accessible and relatively low-cost hardware and open-source software on a robot platform, to encourage people to learn robotics and ROS and make it as easy as possible to do so.
